# countdown number's game
experimental approach at countdown's number game:
a random target number between 0 - 1000 is selected, and 6 random numbers out of two sets consisting of 
[100,75,50,25] and [1-9]. The goal is to get as close to the target number as possible, 
using the six numbers in basic mathematical operations (-,+,/,*). E.g., 
if the target is 521, and 100, 30, 5, 6, 1, 4 where drawn, one could 
get to the target via: (5 * 100) + ((30 / 6) * 4) + 1.
